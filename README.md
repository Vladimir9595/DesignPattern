# Design Patterns

## Exercise 1 : 
- Modelization of a fruit salad. 
- Modelization of a fruit salad factory according to the seasons (winter or summer) (add it to your diagram).

      alt="PatternFactory"
    />
  </a>
  
- Code of the exercise folder [FruitSalade](./FruitSalade/).

## Exercise 2: 
- You're a mad scientist trying to create an army of 2-headed cats. You soon realize that it will take a long time to reproduce this animal in a modified form. So you decide to clone them.

      alt="PatternPrototype"
    />
  </a>

- Code of the exercise folder [CloneCat](./CloneCat/).

## Exercise 3: 
- Model the construction of a car. The car can fly or float on water. There are only two components requiring modeling, the others being basic. 
	- There's a specific propulsion system for water or air. 
	- There is a navigation system specific to water or air. 
The design pattern to use is the Decorator Pattern.

## Exercise 1 : 
- Modelization of a fruit salad. 
- Modelization of a fruit salad factory according to the seasons (winter or summer) (add it to your diagram).

- Code of the exercise folder [FruitSalade](./FruitSalade/).

Exercise 2: 
- You're a mad scientist trying to create an army of 2-headed cats. You soon realize that it will take a long time to reproduce this animal in a modified form. So you decide to clone them.
